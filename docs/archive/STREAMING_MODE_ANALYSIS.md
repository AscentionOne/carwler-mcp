# Streaming Mode Analysis for MCP Integration

## Decision: Streaming Mode Marked as Experimental (Not for MCP)

**Date**: September 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Remove streaming mode from main CLI, mark as experimental  
**Rationale**: Not suitable for MCP server integration patterns

## Analysis

### MCP Use Case Requirements

**Primary Goal**: Crawl information and provide complete, useful data to Claude

**Claude's Information Needs**:
- Complete context to formulate comprehensive responses
- All related content available before starting analysis
- Reliable, structured data for reasoning

**Typical MCP Request Patterns**:
```typescript
// Pattern 1: Single URL
Request: crawl-url("https://docs.example.com/api")
Response: { content: "...", metadata: "..." }  // COMPLETE response needed

// Pattern 2: Small batch (3-5 URLs)
Request: crawl-docs("https://docs.example.com", depth: 2)
Response: [result1, result2, result3]  // ALL results needed together

// Pattern 3: Cache retrieval
Request: get-cached("https://docs.example.com/api", section: "authentication")
Response: { content: "..." }  // COMPLETE cached content
```

### Why Streaming Mode is NOT Suitable for MCP

1. **MCP Protocol is Request-Response**
   - Claude makes request → waits for complete response → uses data
   - No support for streaming/partial responses in MCP protocol
   - Claude cannot start responding with incomplete information

2. **Claude Needs Complete Context**
   - Must analyze all available information before responding to user
   - Partial results would lead to incomplete or incorrect responses
   - Better to wait for all data than provide partial answers

3. **MCP Batch Sizes are Small**
   - Typical: 1-10 URLs per request
   - Streaming overhead not justified for small batches
   - Batch mode already very fast (0.7-2.8 URLs/sec)

4. **Reliability Over Complexity**
   - MCP integration requires stable, predictable responses
   - Streaming adds complexity and potential failure points
   - Simple batch mode is more suitable for server integration

5. **Token Management is More Important**
   - MCP responses limited to ~2000 tokens
   - Focus should be on smart summarization, not streaming
   - Caching and content chunking are higher priorities

### What MCP Actually Needs

**✅ Essential for MCP:**
- Fast, reliable batch processing (1-10 URLs)
- Smart token management and content summarization
- Robust caching for repeated requests
- Clean error handling and fallbacks
- Consistent response formats

**❌ Not needed for MCP:**
- Real-time streaming of partial results
- Progress indicators for human users
- Complex async result handling
- Streaming protocol overhead

### Implementation Decision

**Streaming Mode Status**: ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL - NOT FOR MCP**

**Removed from main CLI**:
- `--stream` flag removed from help text
- Streaming logic simplified out of batch processing
- Focus on reliable batch mode for MCP integration

**Kept for MCP optimization**:
- Configuration presets (docs, news, api)
- Strategy selection (browser vs HTTP)
- Performance tuning options
- Batch processing with complete results

## Conclusion

The user's assessment is **100% correct**. Streaming mode should be marked as experimental and not used in MCP because:

1. **MCP is fundamentally request-response**, not streaming
2. **Claude needs complete information** to provide useful responses  
3. **MCP use cases are small batches** where streaming provides no benefit
4. **Simplicity and reliability** are more important for server integration

The crawler MCP should focus on **reliable batch processing** with **smart token management** and **robust caching** - not streaming complexity.
